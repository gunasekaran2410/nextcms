  - description: An Innovation idea needs the right implementation to find success.
      It is not just the action, but right action determines the product fate.
      We focus on the right way of building the product with the right
      technology.

  - description: Change is the only thing that is constant. A product that does not
      iterate has an expiry date tagged to it as soon as it comes out. Through
      an iterative process, we can keep the original focus, validating for
      current situations, helping us keep the ideas fresh and products
      competitive.
